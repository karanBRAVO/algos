# algos
- This repo is created to store algorithms.
- <--- In Search Spot --->
- I have made a program that shows the spot finder algorithm
- Preview: 
- ![searchSpot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77043443/193542166-960ff571-441b-405c-b403-8177256f7a9d.png)
- red node -> start node
- aqua node -> end node
- black nodes -> barriers
- when it finds the end node the program stops
- <--- In Shortest Path --->
- to find the shortest path b/w start and end node
- this is without the obstacles
- ![shortestPath](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77043443/193543004-32def3af-5c96-4bb0-8721-d23b676c6544.png)
- <--- Shortest Path 2 --->
- with the obstacles
- Todo

- Try all the stuffs yourself.
